Many ecological processes are best represented by individual-based models
(IBMs), where processes at the scale of individual scale of organisms and their
actions are modeled explicitly. Such processes can pose a problem for management
or control; our observational scale, control levers, or management goals may be
limited to coarser scales than the individual.

IBMs suffer from the curse of dimensionality. The number of possible states of
the system, which consists of the possible states and combinations thereof of
all individuals, is enormous. This makes it difficult to apply control
techniques or various levels of system analysis.

One approach to this problem is to apply optimal control techniques to an
aggregrated model (AM) that represents an IBM at the population with some loss
of accuracy [@Federico2013]. These techniques require an AM that adequately
approximates the IBM, though. In particular, it can fail in cases of structured,
heterogenous populations of individuals.

@Kevrekidis2009a describe a set of methods for analyzing IBM-like systems at
scales coarser than the individual. In this approach, one contructs a "coarse
time-stepper" that simulates the evolution of the system through time at the
population level. This stepper consists of an IBM, a "lifting" function, and a
"restriction" function. The functions translate between coarse and individual
scales. The "restriction" function summarizes the distribution of individuals in
small set of moments. The "lifting" function generates distributions of
individuals from these moments. Short bursts of the IBM simulate the system in
between. The time stepper can be used to estimate derivatives of the
coarse-level system. Where IBMs are stochastic, this can be accomplished by
repeated lifting and bursts of the IBM to obtain mean values.

This approach, known as "equation-free" or "multi-scale" modeling, allows
simulation at coarse scale by forward integration of the estimated derivatives
rather than full simulation of the IBM. The coarse time stepper can also be used
for other numeric analyses, such as mapping equilibria and bifurcation points of
the system. Equation-free modeling was developed for simulation of systems in
physical chemistry, where molecular-level interactions had to be simulated at
the "beaker" level. In the ecological context, it has been applied to swarm
dynamics [@Raghib2010a] and the evolution of strains of disease
[@Cisternas2004]. The technique hinges on careful selection of the coarse-scale
variables, and a separation of time scales between these variables and higher
moments of the distributions of individuals, which must come into equilibrium
under short bursts of the IBM.

Here I propose an application of equation-free techniques to optimal control in
an ecological context.

Spatial point processes
=======================

@Brown2004 describe a *spatial point process* which represents the dynamics of a
disease spread through a plant population. Plants are represented as discrete
points in continuous space, and each individuals' infection and mortality are
discrete events that occur in continuous time. Specifically, a suseptible
individual may be converted to an infected one at a probability which is the sum
of the force of infection from all other infected individuals, weighted by a
disease disperal kernel. For any individual, infection is a Poisson process,
where infection occurs at random times driven by a mean rate, as is mortality,
which occurs at fixed rate for infected individuals. At the population level,
the dynamics of the disease can be approximated by a set of differential
equations:

$\def\CSI{\mathcal C_{SI}} \def\dCSI{\dot{\mathcal{C}}_{SI}}$

$$\begin{aligned} 
  \dot S &= -\beta (1 + \CSI) SI - \alpha S \\
  \dot I &= \beta (1 + \CSI) SI + \alpha S - \mu I \\
  \dCSI &= f(S, I, \CSI, \ldots)
\end{aligned}$$

Here $S$ and $I$ are the populations of suseptible and infected individuals,
$\beta$ is the overall contact rate between them and $\alpha$ the background
infection rate from exogenous spore pressure, and $\mu$ is the mortality rate
for diseased plants. $\CSI$ is a spatial covariance term. It is essentially the
integral of the distribution of distances between pairs of plants, weighted by
the dispersal kernel of the disease.

The evolution of $\CSI$ can not described by a closed-form equation. It must be
simulated at the individual scale and depends on the particular arrangement in
space of individuals. However, using the equation-free framework, we can
construct a coarse-time stepper that estimates $\Delta S, \Delta I$, and
$\Delta \CSI$ over short intervals.

Control of the spatial point process
====================================

In addition to the internal system dynamics, we also introduce a control
variable, $h$, which represents a harvest of plants:

$$\def\CSI{\mathcal C_{SI}}
\def\dCSI{\dot{\mathcal{C}}_{SI}}$$

$$\begin{aligned} 
  \dot S &= -\beta (1 + \CSI) SI - \alpha S - h S \\
  \dot I &= \beta (1 + \CSI) SI + \alpha S - \mu I - h I \\
  \dCSI &= f(S, I, \CSI, h, \ldots)
\end{aligned}$$

Managers may harvest plants in order to reduce rate of disease-induced mortality.
plants provide an ecosystem service continuously ($\gamma$ per plant per unit
time) as long as they are alive, which managers want to maximize. However, the
only tool they have at their disposal (in this sylized model) is harvesting
the plant population to reduce contact rates, irrespective of plant disease status. Harvesting occurs
at a rate $h$, the portion of plants removed per unit time, and the cost are
$c(S+I)$, where $c$ is the cost of removing a plant.

The (current-value) Hamiltonian equation of this system is:

$$\begin{aligned}
  \mathcal H = &\gamma S + \gamma I - chS - chI + 
               \lambda_1 (-\beta (1 + \CSI) SI - \alpha S - h S) + \\
               &\lambda_2 (\beta (1 + \CSI) SI + \alpha S - \mu I - h I)  + 
               \lambda_3 (f(\cdot))
\end{aligned}$$

The final term, $\lambda_3 (f(\cdot))$, represents the shadow price of the
spatial correlation, or the value of having the individuals arranged in their
particular configuration. We can determine the evolution of the shadow prices by differentiating $\mathcal H$:

$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial \lambda_1}{\partial t} = 
  -\frac{\partial \mathcal H}{\partial S} - \delta \lambda_1 &=
  -\gamma + ch -\lambda_1 (-\beta (1 + \CSI) I - \alpha - h - \delta)
  - \lambda_2 (\beta (1 + \CSI) I + \alpha)
  - \lambda_3 \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial S}\right) \\
\frac{\partial \lambda_2}{\partial t} = 
  -\frac{\partial \mathcal H}{\partial I} - \delta \lambda_2 &=
  -\gamma + ch - \lambda_1 (-\beta (1 + \CSI) S)
  -\lambda_2 (\beta (1 + \CSI + \delta) S - \mu - h)
  - \lambda_3 \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial I}\right) \\
\frac{\partial \lambda_3}{\partial t} = 
  -\frac{\partial \mathcal H}{\partial \CSI} - \delta \lambda_3  &=
  -\lambda_1 (-\beta SI) - \lambda_2(\beta SI)
  - \lambda_3 \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial \CSI} + \delta \right)
\end{aligned}$$

(With $\delta$ being the discount rate)

The derivatives of $f$ in these equations can be approximated if our forward
integration scheme estimates the second derivative of $\CSI$, which it will if
the forward integrator uses a polynomial scheme.

$$\frac{\partial f}{\partial S} = 
  \frac{\partial f / \partial t}{\partial S / \partial t}  \approx
  \frac{\Delta \dCSI}{\Delta S}$$

For any of the derivatives above, though, we require $h$, which can be
calculated using the maximum principle:

$$\begin{aligned}
    &\frac{\partial \mathcal H}{\partial h} = -cS - cI + \lambda_1 S + \lambda_2 I + 
    \lambda_3 \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial h}\right) = 0 \\
    &\frac{\partial f}{\partial h} -
    \frac{S(c - \lambda_1) + I(c - \lambda_2)}{\lambda_3} = 0
\end{aligned}$$

Here we must approximate $h$ by using a Newton-type method where we calculate
$\partial f / \partial h$ by finite differences, repeated calling the
time-stepper. This may be the most numerically costly and challenging component
of the scheme, especially when the time-stepper is stochastic.

With the above calculations, we can wrap the Hamiltonian set of ODEs, in a
differential equation solver, and additionally in a boundary value solver to
determine optimal paths.

I note that this scheme requires that the IBM have an explicit implementation of
a "lifting function" for the harvest variable. This could take many potential
forms which would correspond to different harvest "strategies". That is, there
are many ways that plants could be harvested from the spatial point distribution
for any given rate: randomly, in a fixed or responsive spatial pattern, etc.
This optimization can only find the best harvest path for any given "strategy".

Generalization
==============

This approach should be applicable to similar systems where there is a tractable
profit function at the coarse scale $(\pi)$ but where the evolution of the
system can only be simulated by a "black box" function $(f)$.

$$\dot S = f(S, h)$$ $$\mathcal H = \pi(S, h) + \lambda f(\cdot)$$
$$\frac{\partial \lambda}{\partial t} = 
  -\frac{\partial \pi}{\partial S} 
  -\lambda \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial S} - \delta \right)
  \approx -\frac{\partial \pi}{\partial S} 
  -\lambda \left(\frac{\Delta \dot S}{\Delta S} - \delta \right)$$
$$h^* = h \text{ given } \left\{\frac{\partial \pi}{\partial h} + \lambda \frac{\partial f}{\partial h} = 0\right\}$$

Questions and Next Steps
========================

-   Has something like this been implemented before? I think the multi-scale
    approach combined with optimal control such as this is novel, but I would
    not be surprised if a numerical approach had been taking to solving adjoint
    and maximum equations before.
-   I'm working on implementing a coarse time-stepper for the spatial point
    process. The thorniest part here is generating a sample spatial point fields
    from a given $\CSI$ value. This will probably be the computational
    bottleneck so I'm working on an efficient approach for it. From there I'll
    work on the algorithm from the inside out.
