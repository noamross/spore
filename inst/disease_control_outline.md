# Outline for Optimal Control of Fungal Disease Paper

## Introduction

-   Control of diseases as an economic problem
-   Review of Sudden Oak Death, Chytrid, WND as load-driven diseases
-   Review of multiple-infection literature
-   Refer to @Ross2015 for outline of disease-interaction issues
-   Individual-based models for stochastic problems and extinction scenarios, small populations (See @Briggs2010)





## Methods

-  Describe IBM model of disease
-  Describe mix of available controls, how controls are implemented in the model
-  Describe

## Analyses

-  Path under single control
-  Path under double controls

## Discussion

-  Best approach to dealing with stochastic epidemic
    -   Limit control to later period when disease is controllable?


# Paper 2: Fitting multiple infections


#  Explain Conway-Maxwell-Poisson Distribution

#  Introduce package

Fit to @Meentemeyer2004 data on # of infected leaves or number of cankers per plant.
